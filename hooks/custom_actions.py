        Generate a list of actions that should be made available via the right-click context menu on a work file or
        publish in the main file view.

        Each action returned should be a dictionary containing the name (should be unique) and the UI caption to use
        in the menu.

                                    the following fields:

                                                      or 'publish' for publishes.

                                    Additionally, for work files (type is 'work'), the dictionary will also contain:

                                    - modified_at   - The date/time the file was last modified on disk
