    entities:
        type: list
        description: "This setting defines the different tabs that will show up on the left hand side.
                      Each tab represents a Shotgun query, grouped by some shotgun fields to form a tree.
                      This setting is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary in the list defines one tab,
                      and should have the following keys: *caption* specifies the name of the tab, *entity_type*
                      specifies the Shotgun Entity type to display. *filters* is a list of standard API Shotgun
                      filters either in the standard or complex format. *hierarchy* is a list of Shotgun fields
                      relative to the entity type, defining the grouping of the tree. An optional *sub_query*
                      key can be used to define a deferred query which will be run to collect children when
                      an Entity is expanded in the tree view, typically Tasks for a Shot or an Asset.
                      It is a dictionary with the following keys: *entity_type* key to specify the child Entity
                      type to collect, *link_field* the Shotgun field name used to link the Entity to its parent,
                      *filters* a list of standard Shotgun API filters, *hierarchy* a list of fields defining
                      the grouping in the sub-tree.
                      The optional *step_filter_on* setting is an Entity type and can be used to restrict
                      the list of Steps used for filtering to only the Steps for the specified Entity type.
