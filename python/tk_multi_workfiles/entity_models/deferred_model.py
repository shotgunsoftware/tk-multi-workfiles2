class ShotgunDeferredEntityModel(ShotgunExtendedEntityModel):
    """
    A Shotgun Entity model which supports two steps for loading data:
    - A primary request is used to populate top nodes in the tree, like for
      a regular Shotgun Entity Model.
    - Secondary requests are deferred until the point the data really needs
      to be fetched, typically when a leaf in the primary model is expanded.
      The primary tree is then extended with child items dynamically retrieved
      on demand with the deferred queries.

    Deferred queries need to specify:
      - The target entity type for the query, e.g. 'Task'.
      - The field name to link the secondary query to the primary one, e.g.
        'entity'.
    A sub-hierarchy can be defined with a list of fields, e.g. ['step'].
    If needed, additional filters can be specified for deferred queries.

    Typical use of a deferred model would look like:
     .. code-block:: python
            my_model = ShotgunDeferredEntityModel(
                # Main query: retrieve Shots and group them by Sequences.
                "Shot",
                [],
                ["sg_sequence", "code"],
                # Deferred query: retrieve Tasks using the "entity" field to retrieve
                # Tasks for a given Shot, group Tasks by their pipeline Step.
